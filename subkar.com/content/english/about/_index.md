### Subha

![alt text](/images/subha.jpg "Subha")

Put Subha into a room with few Post-It notes and some sharpies, she’ll walk out with a clear plan and strategy to effectively reach any goals.

Living by the principle of Mahatma Gandhi **“Be the Change you want to see in the World“**, Subha loves to spend time with family & friends,  listens to podcasts & music, loves gardening & watching movies.

### Karthik


Developing software since childhood, Karthik is a technology enthusiast and cares about every little things around him. Lives by the principle of **“Love, Serve & Care”** in all walks of his life.

When he’s not crafting FoodALot, Karthik spends time with family & friends, fly drones, listen to Audible books, play with Raspberry Pi projects and rave about his Mazda CX9.
